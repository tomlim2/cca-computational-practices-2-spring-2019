# Carbon Dioxide Cycle Simulation

Interactive Carbon Dioxide Cycle Simulation

## Summary

The goals of my project is building interactive simulation of carbon dioxide cycle. I'm interested in environmental issues, and I have learned about climate science. One science article said that today's startegy of learning science is different from the past. In the past it was about studying textbook, but today science communities have tried to appeal based on entertainment such as game, and interactive story-telling.

It will be interactive screen-based media. It could be website or installation using projector.

## Component Parts

From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts.

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: 
- Week 3:
- Week 4:
- Week 5: Present!
